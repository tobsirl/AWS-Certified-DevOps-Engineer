# AWS CloudFormation Cheat Sheet

- A service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

## Features

- CloudFormation allows you to model your entire infrastructure in a text file called a template. You can use JSON or YAML to describe what AWS resources you want to create and configure.
  If you want to design visually, you can use AWS CloudFormation Designer.
- CloudFormation automates the provisioning and updating of your infrastructure in a safe and controlled manner. You can use Rollback Triggers to specify the conditions that CloudFormation should monitor during stack creation and updating.
  If any of the conditions are violated, CloudFormation rolls back changes to the stack.
