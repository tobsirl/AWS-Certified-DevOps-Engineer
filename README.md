## IAM, ACCOUNTS & ORGANIZATIONS

### IAM Identity Policies

IAM Identity Policies are JSON documents that define permissions for an IAM principal (user or role). They are attached to IAM principals and define what the principal can and cannot do. They are evaluated when a principal makes a request to AWS.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
